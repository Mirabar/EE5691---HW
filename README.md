My Implementation of various clustering algorithms as part of the Clustering and Unsupervised Learning course

## Description

HW1 - Maximum Likelihood Estimation for two cases: 
      1. unknown mean
      2. unknowen mean, variance and priors
      
HW2 - [Unsupervised optimal fuzzy clustering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/192473/)

HW3 - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
